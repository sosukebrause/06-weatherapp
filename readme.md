# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard allows the user to search for weather conditions by the zip code of a city in the US

## Functionality

When the search button is clicked, a get request is made to the [open weather map API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) and the data is populated in the html elements of the page using JavaScript and JQuery.

Each city searched for is prepended in a search history list column and the user may click on any of these items to view its weather conditions

## Styling

Bootstrap was implemented for stying, using cards and containers for templating and mobiliy responsive design.
